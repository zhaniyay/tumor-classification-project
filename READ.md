# Tumor Classification Project

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning classifier using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm from **scikit-learn** to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.

## Libraries Used

- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks like classification, training, and evaluation.
- **train_test_split**: To split the data into training and testing sets.
- **GaussianNB**: The Naive Bayes classifier used in the project.
- **accuracy_score**: To evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, which is available through **scikit-learn**. It contains data about cell features taken from breast cancer biopsies and is labeled with the class of tumor (malignant or benign).
